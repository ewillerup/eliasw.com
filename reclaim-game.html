	<h3>"Reclaim" dev log</h3>
	<img class="thumbnail" src="reclaim-game/reclaim-1.png" alt=""></a>
	<p>
		"Reclaim" is a game I made for the GIMM Jam, a 14 day individual game jam where the theme was "Overgrown."
	</p>
	<p>
		Desperate to work on something other than school I signed up fast upon hearing its announcement.
		I envisioned a game about planting weeds in an abandoned city, taking over old concrete ruins and turning it into a jungle.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a recent enthusiasm for couch splitscreen multiplayer games, and so I wanted to make a Risk-style territory takeover game 
		where two or more players compete to cover a city block with their plant. Unlike Risk though, it would be in real-time, hopefully 
		encouraging some competition and chaos at the play session.
	</p>
	<p>
		I decided to go with a voxel-like grid map. I like the asymmetry and odd territory shapes of Risk, but for the two-week scope I 
		decided to keep it simple. The player would be able to plant on the ground of course, but I envisioned the player planting on 
		many surfances, including walls and ceilings. This would add a 3D twist to the traditional 2D map. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I seperated the map into tiles and let the player jump from one to the next. Writing a script that took in the player's desired
		direction, camera direction, nearby tiles, and more turned out to be the most cumbersome task of the project, challenging my
		Vector3 and C# skills. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I wanted to make the game playable with controller. Using a cursor to click on tiles was out of the picture. 
		This meant making a tile highlighter that can be moved in 4 directions, good for keyboard and controllers.
	</p>
	<img class="thumbnail" src="reclaim-game/reclaim-dev-2.jpg" alt=""></a>

	<p>
		One problem I ran into was the program couldn't tell whether the camera was facing away from a wall or towards it. The tiles 
		don't know if they are walls or floors or ceilings. Plus, a tile could be either a floor or a ceiling (like a suspended 
		platform or bridge). I didn't want to have to check a bool on each and every tile to define their state, so I hacked this by 
		shooting a raycast from the tile when the player moves that looks for nearby tiles and figures out whether its a wall/ceiling/whatever.
	</p>
	<img class="thumbnail" src="reclaim-game/reclaim-dev-4.PNG" alt=""></a>
	<p>
		If any fellow rookies out there want advice about attempting 3D tile maps: write out every 
		possible scenario the player might be in and program for that. Make it easily expandable and automatic so making maps isn't 
		tedious.
	</p>

	<p>
		With a week left on the jam the scope creep settled in. I knew I wouldn't be able to make a two-player game out of my engine in 
		that little time, so it was time to chop off some limbs, so to speak. 
	</p>

	<p>
		When testing my game I had some fun just turning off my brain and moving around the scene, planting plants. I decided 
		to lean into the calming nature of the game and pivoted to a freeplay singleplayer mode where the player could do whatever 
		they wanted. I kept the "master plant," which the player must visit to pick up seeds. I added an audio atmosphere and made some  
		relaxing music which plays every few minutes.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this state, I submitted the game a day early.
	</p>

	<p>
		Overall my game jam had some bumps but I was able to find solutions and make a decent prototype for the jam. There are many things 
		I want to add, and so I will probably keep working on Reclaim in the future. Its fun to boot up every now and then which I think is a 
		good sign.
